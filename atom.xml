    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A distruted team can be viewed as the necessary evil or the way of the future, or both, depending on where you are coming from. Essencially, for different reasons that we&#8217;ll discuss later in this post, you sometimes find yourself in need of hiring people from across the globe, and working in a fast, dynamic, highly professional enviornment with a distributed team just complicated things farther.. or does is?</p>

<h2>what is a distrubuted team?</h2>

<p>Wikipedia (that also calls this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_team">virtual team</a>) defines a distributed team as</p>

<blockquote><p>a group of individuals who work across time, space and organizational boundaries with links strengthened by webs of communication technology</p></blockquote>

<p>A while my friend @kesor tells me to never read the first line of wikipedia, I often find this first line to be summerizing the content wonderfully. Notice that there&#8217;s no mentioning of the fact that the team is a development team, and that being distributed means organizational boundaries as well as space and time boundries.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s discuss those quialities.</p>

<h3>Space</h3>

<h3>Time</h3>

<h3>Organizational boundaries</h3>

<h2>when do you need to go distributed?</h2>

<h2>pros and cons</h2>

<h2>how do you manage a distributed team?</h2>

<h2>tools of the trade</h2>
